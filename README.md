#### About the data set

Here we present the data set that was created during the research seminar "Computational Methods for Multilingual Parallel Copora Data Analysis".
The data set consists of sentences that contain the uses of modal verbs and other expressions related to non-epistemic necessity.
The sentences were automatically extrated from Master and Margarita translations (woland corpus, https://github.com/averkij/woland) and then were manually annotated. The annotation refers to specific language expressions that were used to mark non-epistemic necessity (modal verbs plus other grammatical and lexical expressions).
Since the data set was created from cratch and in a limited period of time, it may contain errors, which hopefully are going to be corrected.
